# next steps

### help me

 - figure out rotate models. e.g. the cowhead should be facing the other way, also we need to rotate the barn

 - decide how big the maze should be. should it be narrower and have less divides / wider spaces?


 ### questions

 - how do we make the scene load faster and not fuck people's computers up without making the maze super tiny? should I resize the model and make more 

 - is it possible to add tiny animations like, just having things slightly rotate and hover, or would that also make the scene run really slow? 

 - can you show me how to add material to a primative and put it in the scene again? (I don't know if this new set up affects how I would go about doing that.) 

 - should I remodel the barn? I have a way better understanding of how to do this now. 

 - how do we record and communicate our process within the piece? 


 ## stuff to do

 - try changing the sky box color. see if we can put a texture on there and what will this do to the lights. Possibly add more lights

 -  less urgent, but figure out if it would work to use objs and mtl, so that we can have images as textures on custom models. 

 - adding a bunch of html pages, so we can load some of animation with the correct textures and associated "storylines." I have already been making little videos for certain things. 

 - talk more about coming up with a system of relating our independent memory objects to each other when navigating the scene.

 - make it feel more like geocites. adding stuff like "welcome to my page" & "online now" (maybe in html pages)

 - just keep making cute stuff.
